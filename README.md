# profanity
Profanity is a small binary file that uses your alias and a small file to keep track of how many times you have said a no-no word.

## Getting started:
To get started with Profanity, you would use the command Profanity init. This command creates a little file in your home directory to store all of your profane actions. You will only have to type this once. In fact, you don't even have to type this since Profanity creates this file if it does not exist anyway.

## How to use Profanity, the basic commands:
Profanity can be used in a variaty of ways, you can call the programm from your command line using `profanity`. This will display a little help text to get you started. Same goes for the -h and -help parameters.

#### To use Profanity like a basic pro:
type `profanity addWord <yourWord>` in your terminal. This adds an alias for that word in your ~/.bash_aliases file along the lines of `alias <yourWord>='profanity add <yourWord>';`. The next time you type your word in the terminal you will get a message telling you that Santa is watching your every move.

#### To use Profanity like a basic l33t h4x0r:
Profanity has multiple ways to increment on your naughty-words list. For example, you can type `Profanity <naughtyWord>` or `Profanity add <naughtyWord>`. Both ways are valid, and both ways will make Santa sad.

## How to use Profanity, the advanced commands:
Profanity comes with an array of tools to get your no-no word-list, and a few tools to erase your very naughty past.

#### To use Profanity like an advanced pro:
You can type `Profanity get` to get a list of words you've added to the no-no list, and the times you've said them. Alternatively, to erase your dirty past, you can type `Profanity rem` to clear your murky history.

#### To use Profanity like an advanced l33t h4x0r:
I hear you say: "An advanced l33t h4x0r, is this guy for real?". Yes, yes I am. To use Profanity like read the title again, you would type `Profanity get <naughtyWord>` to get the results of just that one word. To remove just a single word you would type `Profanity rem <naughtyWord>`.

## Using Profanity in combination with other "software":
I have no idea how well Profanity plays along with other software. You can test it for me and report back if you wish, but I like to think that Profanity is the baddest motherducker on the block that steals your lunch money.
